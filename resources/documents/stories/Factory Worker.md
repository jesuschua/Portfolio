# Factory worker

I've worked in exactly two factories in my life. I hated one, and worhipped the other. I will never know what my life would have been without the experiences and trials and joys and pain and friendships I've gained in these two places. 20 years later, thousands of kilometers away, surrounded by the strangeness of an entirely different country, I feel like I can talk about these two places candidly. The places. The food. The group of young engineers I was happy to share my life with. Good and bad, I miss them. And hope I can see them again.
