I've worked in exactly two factories in my life. I hated one, and worhipped the other. I will never know what my life would have been without the experiences and trials and joys and pain and friendships I've gained in these two places. 20 years later, thousands of kilometers away, surrounded by the comfort and strangeness of an entirely different country, I feel like I can finally talk about them.
