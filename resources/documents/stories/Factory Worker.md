## Samsung and Photocircuits

I've worked in two factories in my life. The first one was Samsung Electronics Philippines from 2004 to 2005, and the other one was Photocircuits Philippines from 2005 to 2007. The factories were located in neighboring industrial parks in Laguna and Batangas around 60km from Manila. Samsung and Photocircuits were close enough to each other that they shared the same employee transportation service. In most cases, they shared the same bus, but the workers never sat together on the same ride. This was an important distinction at that time.

Coming into our nightshift at Samsung, we would wait for our bus at a shared stop. The bus would arrive still bearing a large "Photocircuits" placard at the front, indicating that it was ferrying the workers home from their dayshifts. Photocircuits employees would disembark, the driver would flip the card and it would then say "SEPHIL" (abbreviation for Samsung Electronics Philippines). Samsung workers would get on, ask each other how much they did NOT sleep that day, and be ferried to our respective factory. That was the status quo. As far as I know, with probably a few exceptions here and there, workers from the two companies never personally met or fraternized with each other. They were simply too different.

Samsung was production focused so the bulk of the workforce were test jig operators and repairmen. Photocircuits, on the other hand, was the front-end engineering and tooling arm of an even larger production factory in the US and China. The Philippine workers were fewer, and I remember them always keeping to themselves. It gave them an air of superiority.

I should also mention that design engineers from Samsung were always trying to get themselves hired at Photocircuits. I will get to that later. Let me explain how I got to know the company from school.

### Like moths to a flame
I graduated with a degree in engineering from Mapua Institute of Technology in Intramuros, Manila. I spent 6 years of my life there from 1998 to 2004. I was never a good student, and was always under the trance of some religious or artistic distraction. I did not take it as seriously as I should have.

Coming from a lower-tier middle class family supported by only one bread-winner, my status as a private paying student was always under the threat of failing academics, or financial difficulties, or both. I was lucky to have graduated and received my electronic engineer's license at all.

Around the final year of school, just before the government-administered licensure exams, one gets to attend job fairs inside the campus. There are booths set up by companies to meet and interview candidates from the different engineering branches. For electronics, the top companies at that time were Intel, Analog Devices and Amkor, and a new one called Photocircuits. These interviews were reserved for the best students and often by invitation only.

I was of course not invited, but I had some friends and acquaintances who were. All of them noted that the exam for Photocircuits was hard, that the examiners were snobbish, and that if hired, the position almost always guaranteed a sponsored process training in Glen Cove, New York.

Later that year, probably because Photocircuits did not get enough talents and candidates from the schools, they posted the job position publicly and made it open to all new graduates. It gave me a chance to meet and get rejected by these examiners myself. 

With hindsight now, fully knowing what the company itself was going through. They were not intending to have an air of superiority or snobbishness. The business simply needed the best minds they could get for the dwindling money they had, to brace for impact for the eventual decline of American hi-tech manufacturing industry.

It was a lot to grasp. Even now I do not think we know how polarized and asymmetrical a concept like globalization really is. At that time, as a young man fresh out of college, I only cared about the pain of getting rejected by a company I wanted so much to be a part of. And it was in this low time in my life when I got the call from Samsung. 

During the interview, the Korean manager asked me where I see myself in 5 years. I told him I see myself deeply entrenched and knowledgeable about the engineering side of optical media writers and players. I got the job even though I lied. It was not Samsung's products I cared most about.
