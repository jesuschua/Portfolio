## Samsung and Photocircuits

I've worked in two factories in my life. The first one was Samsung Electronics Philippines from 2004 to 2005, and the other one was Photocircuits Philippines from 2005 to 2007. The factories were located in neighboring industrial parks in Laguna and Batangas around 60km from Manila. Samsung and Photocircuits were close enough to each other that they shared the same employee transportation service. In most cases, they shared the same bus but the workers never sat together on the same ride. This was an important distinction at that time.

Coming into our nightshift at Samsung, we would wait for our bus at a shared stop. The bus would arrive still bearing a large "Photocircuits" placard at the front, indicating that it was ferrying the workers back from their dayshifts. All Photocircuits employees would disembark, then the bus driver would simply flip the card and it would say "SEPHIL" (abbreviation for Samsung Electronics Philippines). Samsung workers would get on, ask each other how much they did NOT sleep that day, and be ferried to their respective factory. That was the process. And as far as I know, with probably very few exceptions, workers from the two companies never personally interacted or fraternized with each other. They were simply too distinct. Aside from sharing a bus, they shared nothing else.

Samsung was a fully-functioning multi-line production facility that assembled, tested, packaged, and shipped out thousands of optical drives per shift. The bulk of its workforce were jig operators and maintenance personnel. Photocircuits, in stark contrast, was a small front-end engineering arm of two production facilities in the US and China. It had no operators. The massive production plant it owned laid mostly unused. Except for the offices and meeting rooms they have wired up in a small section of the plot, the factory was dark, empty, and dusty.

One could say that while Samsung employees worked mostly with their hands, Photocircuits employees worked in front of screens with their minds. Analyzing, pricing, designing, and creating the CAD files necessary for producing PCBs (printed circuit boards). These gaps between the type of work, educational backgrounds, and average level of pay gave Photocircuits men and women an air of superiority whether they wanted it or not. They were a group of highly intelligent people working amidst a sea of non-specialized factory drones.

I should also mention that design engineers from Samsung and every where else were always trying to get themselves hired at Photocircuits. I will get to that later. Let me explain first how I got to know the company from school.

### Like moths to a flame
I graduated with a degree in engineering from Mapua Institute of Technology in Intramuros, Manila. I spent 6 years of my life there from 1998 to 2004. I was never a good student, and was always under the trance of some religious or artistic distraction. I did not take student life as seriously as I should have. I have no excuse, only regrets.

Coming from a lower-tier middle class family supported by only one bread-winner, my status as a private paying student was always under the threat of failing academics, or financial difficulties, or both. I was lucky to have graduated and received an engineer's license at all.

Around the final year of school, just before the government-administered licensure exams, one gets to attend job fairs inside the campus. There are booths set up by companies to meet and interview candidates from the different engineering branches. For electronics, the top companies at that time were Intel, Analog Devices, Amkor, and a new one called Photocircuits. These exams and interviews were reserved for the best students and often given by invitation only.

I was of course not invited, but I had friends and acquaintances who were. All of them noted that the exam for Photocircuits was hard, that the examiners were snobbish, and that if hired, the position almost always guaranteed a sponsored process training in Glen Cove, New York, USA. Later that year, probably because Photocircuits did not get enough talents and candidates from the school fairs, they posted the job position publicly and made it open to all new graduates. It gave me a chance to meet and get rejected by these examiners myself. 

With hindsight now, fully knowing what the company itself was going through. They were not intending to have an air of superiority or be snobby or any of that. The business simply needed the best minds they could get for the dwindling money they had, to pay for debts they were accumulating, and to brace for the eventual decline of the American hi-tech manufacturing industry. It was a lot to grasp. 

Even now expert analysts have a hard time determining the overall winners and losers of globalization. In the early 2000s? No one knew shit. At that time, as a young man fresh out of college, I only cared about the pain of getting rejected. It was in this low time in my life when I got a call from Samsung who was always on a state of hiring.

During the interview, a Korean engineering manager asked me where I see myself in five years. I told him I see myself deeply entrenched and knowledgeable about the engineering side of DVD read/write devices. We take these types of interview questions as cliche now, and comes off almost as a joke. But I swear, the candidate beside me said that in five years, he sees himself managing his own business. I never saw the other candidate again.

### Solder wick and alcohol
One is never given a job in Samsung based on one's competencies or eligibility. One is assigned to whichever department is in need. I was given a repair engineer role and was handed a soldering station after a few days of training. The job was simple enough to understand. Samsung (among other things) produces DVD writer drives. The very same drives one would buy off the shelf or Your production line is divided in two halves, the first few tests jigs focus on data exchange and read/write operations. The
