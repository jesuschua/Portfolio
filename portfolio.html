			<p><strong>Level of involvement</strong></p>
			<p>
			This project required me to be embedded within the development team. I often met and consulted with the following experts:</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Business analysts who provide information about application functionalities. </li>
			<li>Developers who provide updates on functionality or user interface changes.</li>
			<li>Testers who provide the latest functioning builds and bug reports.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
			<p>
			I used the following applications and environments:</p> 
			<ul>
			<li>Robohelp, utilizing custom css to publish the html content into a preliminary Word document.</li>
			<li>Macro-enabled Microsoft Word template, utilizing custom macros and fields to reformat, re-number, and apply headers and footers to sections, and to conform to company-wide template requirements.</li>
			<li>Adobe Acrobat Professional, to transform the Word files into PDF, and to apply PDF-opening defaults.</li>

			<p class="workplace">The Accenture RDBMS Guideline</p></div>
	  <div>
		<p>
		Consulting firms like Accenture and its subsidiaries employ guideline documentation to help keep their development teams informed on regulatory and company policies. One drawback of guidelines documentation is that developers find it hard to read or re-read lengthy expositions on topics they are already familiar with.
		</p>
		<p>
		I performed the guideline update by dividing previously disorganized content into smaller sections, offering links to recently updated topics upfront, removing (with consultation) obsolete or redundant sections, and connecting related topics through hyperlinks.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is a small representative sample of the information security updates applied on existing guidelines. Furthermore, the presentation is not true to form because the content is intended to be consumed through the custom web application that our team maintains. I chose not to re-produce the web application in this demo, focusing instead on the content.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Level of involvement</strong></p>
			<p>
			This project required light to medium involvement. Often involving just me and two experts discussing the changes over email.</p>

	  <h3>VBA Projects</h3>
	  <div>
	  <div class = "highcont">
			<p class="workplace">This section is a work in progress</p></div>
		<p>
		I create documentation-centered VBA macros that range from simple to medium-complexity:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Universal Search and Replace</li>
		  <li>Data Input, Summarization, and Graph Visualization</li>
		  <li>Microsoft Word Rebranding (applying new styles and template settings to legacy Word documents) </li>

		</ul>
	  </div>
	  <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
	  <div>
	  <div class = "highcont">
			<p class="workplace">This section is a work in progress</p></div>
		<p>
		Our team regularly converts software processes into glance-able diagrams in Microsoft Visio. I also summarize and present a wide variety of data sets into easy-to-understand graphics.
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Task Diagrams</li>
		  <li>Raw data vs Visualized data</li>
		</ul>
	  </div>
	  <h3>Data migration</h3>
	  <div>
	  <div class = "highcont">
			<p class="workplace">This section is a work in progress</p></div>
		<p>
		I handled data migration in almost all documentation projects I was deployed in. This page will feature the following migration types:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>From different versions of the same authoring software.</li>
		  <li>From one authoring environment to another (with scripts and custom applications).</li>
		  <li>From a Word-based and shared drive repository system to an authoring environment with database.</li>
		</ul>
	  </div>
	  <h3>About this website</h3>
	  <div>
		<p>
		This website features jQuery accordions nested inside tabs. jQuery UI animations are light-weight, efficient, and relatively easy to implement. It enables the extension of screen real estate while maintaining visual simplicity and order. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
			<p>
			I used the following applications and environments:</p> 
				<ul>
				<li>Notepad++ to write HTML code.</li>
				<li>Github to publish the website.</li>
				<li>Adobe Acrobat Professional to redact sample PDFs.</li>
				</ul>
